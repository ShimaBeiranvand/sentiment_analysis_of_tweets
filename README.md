# sentiment_analysis_of_tweets

Project Overview:
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data to classify tweets as either positive or negative.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is downloaded from the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) corpus. It consists of a collection of tweets, each labeled with a sentiment score (positive or negative).

Methodology:
The data is preprocessed by converting the text of the tweets into numerical features. This is done using techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization. The preprocessed data is then fed into a Logistic Regression model, which is trained to classify the tweets as either positive or negative.

Requirements:
The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

    nltk: For accessing the tweet dataset and performing natural language processing tasks.
    sklearn: For the Logistic Regression model and evaluation metrics.
    numpy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.

Usage:
To run the sentiment analysis, follow these steps:

    Ensure you have the required libraries installed (nltk, sklearn, numpy).
    Run the provided Python script, which will preprocess the data, train the Logistic Regression model, and evaluate its performance.
    The script will output the model's accuracy and sentiment of comments on the test set.
